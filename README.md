
## Project's Title
<p>DNA identification service of the closest sequence in the database to the provided sequence.</p>

## Project Description
<p>The code in this file can be used to identify a dog’s breed based on DNA sequence.
It takes a sequence as input and compares it to known breeds in a database to identify the most probable breed and the percentage of confidence based on alignment.<

<p>If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine like a "POS", you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.
Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.
pip freeze > requirements.txt </p>

## How to Use the Project
<p> Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem – they will always have a place to reference what is expected.
You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.
Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials. </p>
