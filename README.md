What to Include in your README
Project's Title
DNA identification service of the closest sequence in the database to the provided sequence.

Project Description
The code in this file can be used to identify a dog’s breed based on DNA sequence. It takes a sequence as input and compares it to known breeds in a database to identify the most probable breed and the percentage of confidence based on alignment.
•	Why you used the technologies you used,
•	Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is very long, you might want to add a table of contents to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections easily. It will make it easier for readers to move around the project with ease.

How to Install and Run the Project
If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine like a "POS", you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.
Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.
pip freeze > requirements.txt

How to Use the Project
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem – they will always have a place to reference what is expected.
You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.
Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

Credits
If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.
Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.
This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.

Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide code examples and how to run them.
This will help show that you are certain and confident that your project will work without any challenges, which will give other people confidence in it, too
